					<p >Individuals hire ISRA for any circumstance where surveillance is needed to shine a light on a situation. Some of the most common reasons for private investigations for individuals are: suspicions of an unfaithful partner and parents wanting to know more about what their children do in their spare time. People who believe their partner is cheating or, are worried about whether or not their child is lying about their after school activities often hire ISRA to shed light on the situation and get the facts straight before any confrontation occurs.
We also provide tailored services for companies who are suspicion of a member of their team. For more information visit our Surveillance for Companies Page</p>
